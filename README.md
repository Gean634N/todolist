# Welcome to the to-do list project!

## What will be developed?

-A list of tasks web will be developed using `ReactJS`, `CSS` and `TypeScript`.

## What I pretend:

- Add tasks to the list.
- Remove tasks from the list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Remove all completed tasks.
- Clear to-do list.
- Save the list so that when I go back to the site it loads automatically.
- Responsivity as a bonus.
