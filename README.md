# Welcome to the to-do list project!

## What will be developed?

-A list of tasks web will be developed using `ReactJS`, `TypeScript`, `CSS` and `Styled-Components`.

## What I pretend:

- [X] Add tasks to the list.
- [X] Remove tasks from the list.
- [X] Mark tasks as completed.
- [X] Remove all completed tasks.
- [X] Clear to-do list.
- [X] Save the list so that when I go back to the site it loads automatically.
- [ ] Responsivity as a bonus.
